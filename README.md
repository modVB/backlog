## A note on filing suggestion issues

Please avoid creating issues for completely new suggestions. I have a pretty specific vision of where I'm trying to go and years of customer reports/suggestions/bugs to work get through already. Chances are if you've suggested it before I've heard it already and have an idea of how to address the scenario, even if it's not exactly your solution. For right now I'm just one guy in his apartment coding this so please be considerate of both my time and the pressure getting flooded with suggestions and place on me. Of course, if you have feedback on how something is planned or implemented, fire away, tweak level suggestions are welcome just no "You should add pointers to VB"-level suggestions; a one sentence suggestion from you could be months of work for me.

Regards,
